Currently the CO₂ emissions and UNFCCC file have been converted to CSV files.

For the global CO₂ emissions file countries with no data or all values zero
(which could mean no data) and some duplicated columns have been removed.
The "World" column has been multiplied to match the sum of the other columns.
